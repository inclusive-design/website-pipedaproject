Summary</a></h1> <p style="text-align: justify;">This<strong> </strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">document
constitutes the final project report of an investigation funded by the
Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC) Contributions program. A
project proposal was submitted to the OPC on August 13, 2004 and an
award of $48,300 was publicly announced on January 27, 2005 with a
completion date of March 31, 2005 for expenditure of funds related to
the project. </span></p> <p>Research was
undertaken by the Centre for Innovation Law and Policy in close
partnership with the Information Policy Research Program (IPRP). This
culminated in a full day conference which highlighted preliminary
research on March 18, 2005. The conference was webcast and included
leading experts in the field of information privacy.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">The
central aim of this project has been to evaluate the implementation of
the Personal Information and Protection of Electronic Documents
Act<a name="_ftnref1" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn1">[1]</a>
(&quot;PIPED Act&quot;) by reviewing privacy policies posted on the Internet by
companies in the telecommunications, airlines, banking and retail
sectors. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Where
possible we have
made use of publicly available information regarding corporate
information management practices and combined this with a discussion of
topical issues facing the target industry sector in light of
developments at the national and international levels. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;">There
are four substantive papers included in this report based upon
investigations into three federally regulated industry sectors and the
retail sector. Since the PIPED Act had been applied to federal works
since its enactment, we were interested in determining whether
experiences in these industries could be transferred to the retail
sector. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;">In the absence
of clear
legislative mandate at the federal level to regulate privacy with
respect to ‘all commercial activity&#39;, movements at the international
level, particularly the European Union with its Data Protection Working
Party Opinion on information notices and advance passenger information
and passenger name record are likely to have the greatest impact on
privacy discourse in this country. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;">What
we find is that despite having considerable resources to devote to the
issue of privacy the implementation of the PIPED Act has been
<em>ad hoc</em><span style="font-style: normal;">
at best and non-existent at worst. Companies it would appear are
motivated to communicate their information management practices in
large measure as a result of business prudence rather than concerns for
individual privacy. </span></p> <p style="text-align: justify;">While
might be expected, the unwillingness on the part of the OPC to name
respondents that are culpable of the most egregious violations of
individual privacy even where so doing would be ‘in the public
interest&#39; does little to cultivate the jurisprudence in this area, much
to the chagrin of privacy advocates. The dual role of recognizing
business interests and individual rights with respect to privacy - a
value that is far from absolute results in uncertain interpretation and
application of the Act. Coupled with tenuous legal drafting, this
hybrid of legislative instrument and industry code is at times in many
instances ill-suited to further refine our understanding of the privacy
interest and the consequences of the harm caused by the loss of it.

central theme of this project has been a consideration of the extent to
which privacy policies satisfy the requirement of &quot;openness&quot; pursuant
to the PIPED Act. Organizations make information about their policies
and practices available in a variety of ways. The method chosen depends
on the nature of its business and other considerations. An organization
may make brochures in its place of business, mail information to its
customers, provide online access, or establish a toll-free telephone
number. </p> <p>However in many instances this
communication is
motivated by a desire to obfuscate the consumers&#39; attempt to understand
an organizations&#39; information management practice rather than clarify
expectations as between company and consumer. This research has focused
on the approach to communicating privacy policy and practice by
organizations in the airline, telecommunications, banking and retail
sectors. We selected the first three industries because they are
federally regulated and the PIPED Act has applied to them since its
enactment. </p> <p>This principle contemplates the consumer
being
able to ascertain information about the organization&#39;s business
practice with respect to the use collection and disclosure of personal
information without unreasonable effort on the part of the individual.
However, in many instances consumers (and even trained researchers!)
experience considerable difficulty understanding a given organization&#39;s
information management practices. </p> <p>Our work involved
creating
a 26-point questionnaire and contacting the privacy information
officers in the industries mentioned above to learn about the
effectiveness of communicating privacy statements to the public. Our
project team&#39;s research was significantly disadvantaged by University
research ethics board requirements. However a number of chief privacy
officers were willing to be interviewed and this served to inform our
research. In future research we hope to make use of research
instruments of the type designed in this project to provide more a more
quantitative research output. </p> <p>Four papers were
written based
on the industry sectors examined. Each paper considers a current issue
facing the industry and discusses the ways in which a given
organization&#39;s information management practices are communicated to the
public.</p> <p>The first paper titled: &quot;Mathew Englander -
Toonie or Loonie? - Assessing the impact of the <em>Englander v.
Telus</em><span style="font-style: normal;"> decision&quot;
explores privacy in the telecommunications sector through an analysis
of the leading PIPED Act case of </span><em>Englander v
Telus Communications Inc.</em><span style="font-style: normal;">
In this case the court finds that identifying the purpose of
collection, use and disclosure of personal information, while varying
according to circumstances, must take place at the time of collection
in the first instance. The Court suggests that corporate communications
to the consumer can be the basis of a finding of ‘tacit consent&#39; should
if it is eventually demonstrated that customers are aware of the
brochures etc. at the time they subscribe. </span></p>
<p>Making
more information available and accessible to consumers may, given the
depersonalized relationship between consumers and corporations,
eventually serve to abrogate consent in this context. The
<em>Englander</em><span style="font-style: normal;">
case is in many respects an examination of different perspectives on
privacy. The case also exposes the internal contraction of the PIPED
Act, an act seeking to assuage both industry business interests as well
as the privacy concerns of individuals. Without commitment to providing
context-specific analysis and naming respondents in cases that are ‘in
the public interest&#39; the seeds of further confusion are likely to be
sown. </span></p> <p>The second paper in this report
considers the
online privacy statements of four Canadian airlines in light of the
Article 29 Data Protection Working Party Opinion on the level of
protection ensured in Canada for the transmission of Passenger Name
Record (PNR) and Advance Passenger Information (API) from airlines, and
the requirements of the PIPED Act. A discussion of the Working Party
Opinion was considered important in this area because of the
considerable influence the Working Party has on data protection in
non-EU countries. The specific commitments of the Canadian Border
Services Agency are currently the subject of negotiation with the EU
and are currently not being made available to the public. However a
comparison was made between the Working Party Opinion and the
obligations placed on the airline industry pursuant to the PIPED Act.
In the case of airlines the Working Party Opinion highlights a lack of
uniformity in the approach taken by airlines in communicating their
information management practices. The absence of enforcement powers
within the Office of the Privacy Commissioner results in an
inconsistent implementation of the PIPED Act and the basis of systemic
privacy violations. </p> <p>In the third paper, a
comparison is made
between the online privacy notices of two leading Canadian banks CIBC
and Scotiabank in the light of the Article 29 Data Protection Working
Party Opinion on more harmonized information provisions with particular
reference to the proposed European information notice solution. The
proposed information notice is significant from the perspective of
&quot;openness&quot; because it seeks to improve awareness of data protection
rights and responsibilities as well as enhance the quality of
information on data protection. It does this through a three-tier
notice system, the first layer providing ‘core&#39; information and the
second and third more relevant information that is required by the EU
Data Protection Directive and the national law respectively. Taken
together, these would be deemed to constitute a legal notice.</p>
<p>A
comparison of two leading Canadian banks reveals stark differences in
the manner through which information management practices are
communicated to the public. CIBC has its privacy policy in a long
format, where as Scotiabank makes use of embedded links. While both
banks would likely fail to satisfy the EU information notice
requirements, Scotiabank&#39;s notice was found to be more user-friendly.
It was concluded that the harmonization of information notices is
likely to result in greater ease of comparison between information
management practices because companies are forced to make use of an
accepted information template and make information delinquencies more
difficult to conceal. </p> <p>The fourth and final paper
examines
the issues concerning the protection of personal information within the
retail business sector in Canada. This paper considers the extent to
which retail businesses&#39; web site privacy statements address concerns
associated with the collection, use and disclosure of personal
information in this context. The paper points out that the PIPED Act
fails to distinguish between industry sectors other than by
differentiating federal works from other forms of commercial activity.
These latter undertakings are the subject of provincial jurisdiction
and the legal remit of the federal government to legislate in this area
is at present unclear. </p> <p>In addition the PIPED Act
does not
distinguish between small and large retail industries instead imposing
positive obligations on all organizations. This paper concludes by
suggesting that the retail sector is following the lead of the federal
undertakings, but this may well be a movement in the wrong direction.
It recommends the publication of detailed privacy manuals as a means of
providing consumers with a meaningful basis upon which to assess the
companies&#39; information privacy practices and hold them to
account.</p> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br style="page-break-before: always;" /> </span> <h1><a name="_Toc102981609" /><a name="_Toc102981823" /><a name="_Toc102982078" /><a name="_Toc103387384" /><a name="_Toc103387882" /><a name="_Toc103418732">Project Achievements</a></h1>

<p>This paper considers privacy in the telecommunications sector
through an analysis of the recent case of <em>Englander v Telus
Communications Inc.<a name="_ftnref2" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn2">[2]</a></em><span style="font-style: normal;"> as well an in depth discussion with Drew McArthur, CPO at
Telus who was interviewed as part of our research.
</span></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Englander</em><span style="font-style: normal;">
case concerns the interpretation of the PIPED Act with respect to the
personal information published in telephone directories. The
complainant in the case asserted that in failing to obtain the consent
of its first time customers, Telus had contravened the knowledge and
consent requirements of the PIPED Act. It was also alleged that the
charging of a $2 fee for providing a Non-Published Number Service
(NPNS) was in contravention of the spirit, if not the letter, of the
PIPED Act. The Federal Court of Appeal agreed with Mr. Englander&#39;s
reasoning in relation to the knowledge and consent issue, but rejected
the latter argument. </span></p> <p>The case is
significant from the
standpoint of privacy for the following four reasons which will be
examined in turn: First, it provides a view of privacy based on a
particular set of facts from a number of perspectives. As privacy is a
value that must be viewed in its context, we are afforded an analysis
of privacy as applied to a specific set of circumstances. Second, the
case highlights the problem of self-regulatory codes enshrined in
legislative enactment. Third, the Court in
<em>Englander</em><span style="font-style: normal;">
provides some interesting commentary on the principle of openness and
consent and finally, there are some valuable insights on the role of
the Office of the Privacy Commissioner that can be distilled from the
case. </span></p> <p><strong>Perspectives on
Privacy</strong></p> <p>Central
to the privacy debate in the consumer context are three different
perspectives: the activist perspective, the corporate perspective and
the centralist perspective.<a name="_ftnref3" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn3">[3]</a>
The activist perspective argues that harmful social costs will be
incurred if free-market forces and technological advancements proceed
unchecked.<a name="_ftnref4" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn4">[4]</a>
The corporate perspective by contrast takes the view that companies
have a fundamental business imperative to collect, use, and disclose
personal information in the course of operations. The imposition of
unfettered restrictions in this regard may, in certain cases, introduce
market distortions and impede an organization&#39;s ability to compete
efficiently. Lastly, there is the centralist perspective. Here,
proponents contend that consumers require choice. These choices can be
made more meaningful if ‘reasonable&#39; corporate access to personal
information is permitted.<a name="_ftnref5" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn5">[5]</a></p> <p>These perspectives
are seen in the <em>Englander</em><span style="font-style: normal;">
case. Mathew Englander, could well be characterized as an activist;
championing the cause of privacy and vindicating his rights on behalf
of Canadian consumers. Telus typifies the corporate perspective on this
issue, viewing privacy as a variable (and there are many) in the
organization&#39;s operational equation. The court in the
</span><em>Englander</em><span style="font-style: normal;">
case arguably takes a centralist position in partially ruling in favour
of the complainant on the consent issue but agreeing with Telus with
respect to the charging of a $2 fee for NPNS. </span></p>
<p><strong>Breach of Consent
Requirement</strong></p> <p>At
the core of the three perspectives on privacy lies the perennial
question of who controls information given by consumers. This is of
particular salience in this case since the PIPED Act will not apply to
information deemed publicly available.<a name="_ftnref6" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn6">[6]</a> </p> <p>The
argument for regarding personal information contained in a telephone
directory being readily available is supported by the Canadian
Radio-Television and Communications Commission (CRTC).<a name="_ftnref7" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn7">[7]</a>
The telecommunications sector is unique among federally regulated
industries with respect to privacy. This is because in addition to the
requirements of the PIPED Act, telecommunications companies (telcos)
are also subject to regulation by the CRTC which also has as part its
mandate, the protection of privacy.<a name="_ftnref8" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn8">[8]</a> </p> <p>The
CRTC has expressed the view that &quot;the provision of directories form an
essential part of, and significantly enhance the value of, the
company&#39;s basic telephone service.&quot;<a name="_ftnref9" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn9">[9]</a> As a result telcos are required to
distribute directories free of charge to customers.<a name="_ftnref10" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn10">[10]</a>
Moreover, in reporting on directory listings the CRTC commented that
&quot;...subscribers currently expect that, unless they request an unlisted
number, their telephone numbers will be published in the telephone
companies&#39; directories and will be available through directory
assistance.&quot;<a name="_ftnref11" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn11">[11]</a></p> <p>However
the increased accessibility of subscriber information and the ability
to manipulate this data make de-listing one&#39;s name perhaps the only way
of affording the consumer some measure of control concerning how their
data is subsequently used. Taking the above factors into account the
Commission found it appropriate to require telcos to provide NPNS at a
rate that does not exceed $2 per month for residential
subscribers.<a name="_ftnref12" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn12">[12]</a></p> <p>The
Court makes the important observation that while publicly available
information can be collected, used and disclosed without consent, this
cannot apply to the organization that initially collects the
information for the purpose of publishing a telephone directory, which,
once published, will become publicly available.<a name="_ftnref13" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn13">[13]</a> </p> <p>The
Court goes on to note that consent for information that will be made
publicly available must take place on or before the time of enrolment
in the service.<a name="_ftnref14" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn14">[14]</a>
The court&#39;s centralist position with respect to privacy is seen in the
statement that:</p> <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">First-time
customers have the right to know before their personal information
becomes &quot;publicly available&quot; within the meaning of section 7 of the
Act, with all the consequences that might flow from such publicity,
that they can exercise their right to privacy and choose not to be
listed. This seems to me, a fair compromise between one&#39;s right to
privacy and the industry&#39;s needs.</span></p>
<p>Though correct, it is
unfortunate that the Court declined the opportunity to comment on
information in the public sphere. The increased sophistication of data
manipulation technology permits even publicly available information to
be aggregated to provide a detailed digital portraiture of an
individual.<a name="_ftnref15" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn15">[15]</a>
</p> <p>Thus the <em>Englander</em><span style="font-style: normal;">
decision can be regarded as a narrow holding in this regard. Whether
industries beyond the telcos sector will inform their customers of the
consequence of initial collection remains to be seen. Though this is
unlikely, the case deals with a regulated industry sector pursuant to a
fact pattern that is not likely to recur in future cases. Thus its
applicability across the spectrum of businesses would appear limited.
Other telcos however will no doubt be revising their policies to inform
customers of their right to have their information excluded from the
directory for a fee. </span></p>
<p><strong>Charging of Fees</strong></p>
<p>The
complainant, as well as others, is fundamentally opposed to the
imposition of a fee for the right to control how their personal
information is subsequently used.<a name="_ftnref16" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn16">[16]</a>
The view taken is that there are circumstances (such as a victim
suffering spousal abuse) that warrant NPNS as a matter of necessity.
Although it was not argued that there can never be a fee charged for
asserting rights to privacy this could only be accomplished under the
PIPED Act if the statute provided for it.<a name="_ftnref17" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn17">[17]</a>
However it was found that the CRTC, in approving rates and services and
taking into account the protection of the privacy of Canadians, signals
Parliament&#39;s intent that the imposition of fees for providing privacy
services were indeed contemplated. </p> <p>There was also
mention of
the fact that fees for this service may also constitute an economic
barrier to low income groups. The Court made short work of this
argument in stating that while this proposition &quot;may have validity from
an access to services perspective, the use of fees is not specifically
a protection of privacy issue.&quot;<a name="_ftnref18" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn18">[18]</a></p> <p><strong>The
PIPED Act and Self-Regulation</strong></p> <p>Of
relevance in the <em>Englander</em><span style="font-style: normal;">
case are the comments made about the PIPED Act and self-regulation.
Self-regulation takes the traditional governmental regulatory model of
legislation, enforcement and adjudication and applies them to the
private sector.<a name="_ftnref19" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn19">[19]</a>
The fair information practices are rules created for a self-regulatory
regime.<a name="_ftnref20" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn20">[20]</a>
While there is wide support for the principles as sound public policy,
the question that remains, even after the enactment of the PIPED Act,
is whether legislation is the appropriate regulatory instrument in this
context. This is of particular relevance in the advent of the review of
the Act scheduled next year.<a name="_ftnref21" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn21">[21]</a></span></p> <p>The
stated purpose of the PIPED Act is &quot;...to support and promote
electronic commerce by protecting personal information that is
collected, used or disclosed in certain circumstances...&quot; In providing
its historical account of the factors influencing the enactment of the
PIPED Act, the Court examines the tension between the Council of Europe
model for privacy<a name="_ftnref22" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn22">[22]</a> and the fair information practices,
championed by the OECD.<a name="_ftnref23" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn23">[23]</a>
The OECD principles were intended to be non-binding but helped to build
trust and promote disclosure of personal information which in turn,
facilitates relationship marketing.<a name="_ftnref24" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn24">[24]</a>
The Council of Europe model by contrast favoured implementation in to
national law. The tension between the legislative and self-regulatory
approach to privacy protection in the commercial context was a central
theme in the discussions which led to the creation of the Canadian
Standards Association Model Code of the Protection of Personal
Information.<a name="_ftnref25" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn25">[25]</a></p> <p>Part 4 of the CSA
Standard became Schedule 1 to the PIPED Act. Perrin et al<a name="_ftnref26" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn26">[26]</a>
state that &quot;with the full support of the industry players who
contributed to the CSA Standard, but to the great bewilderment of
privacy experts and legal scholars everywhere, the drafters of this
legislation set the task of incorporating the text of the standard in
the law.&quot; As a consequence modifications of the legal text of the Act
would invariably ensue. </p> <p>The problem with this
approach is
that industry codes serve entirely different functions to legislation.
Codes express a general aspiration which is in the main voluntary,
normative, non-binding in orientation and of general applicability.
Legislation on the other hand is prescriptive and creates specific
binding legal rights and obligations. The Court in
<em>Englander</em><span style="font-style: normal;">
notes that the CSA Standard was &quot;the product of intense negotiations
between competing interests, which proceeded on the basis of
self-regulation and which did not use nor purport to use legal
drafting.&quot; </span></p> <p>The incorporation of a
voluntary
instrument into law presents difficulties for analysis of issues in
this context. This is because the rules of statutory construction are
of little application in the context of interpreting a code. This is
underscored by s. 5(2) of the PIPED Act which states that the use of
‘should&#39; does not impose a legal obligation. The Court therefore
concluded that &quot;[i]n these circumstances, flexibility, common sense and
pragmatism will best guide the Court.&quot;<a name="_ftnref27" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn27">[27]</a>
This marked departure from legal reasoning is problematic in the
context of privacy discourse since the value of a decision based on
‘common sense&#39; will be of limited application in future cases.
</p> <p>Coupled
with the protean nature of privacy, which makes it highly elusive to
definition with any legal precision, we find a situation where we are
further away from understanding what is meant by an expectation of
privacy as well as the harms caused by a loss of privacy. Clearly,
privacy is not an absolute value but the present regulatory framework
does little to further our understanding of this concept. The resulting
uncertainty is problematic for both business as well as consumers.
</p> <p><strong>Consent and
Openness</strong></p> <p>As noted above the Court in
<em>Englander</em><span style="font-style: normal;">
held that Telus infringed the consent requirement of Schedule 1 of the
PIPED Act in failing to inform its first time customers, at the time of
enrolment, of the primary and secondary purposes for which their
personal information was collected and not informing them of the
availability of the NPNS. </span></p> <p>The Court
highlights Principle 2, &quot;Identifying Purposes&quot;<a name="_ftnref28" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn28">[28]</a> and 3 &quot;Consent&quot;<a name="_ftnref29" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn29">[29]</a>
to be of particular relevance in the Englander case. These principles,
the Court remarks &quot;...clearly impose on the organization the burden of
making clear to the individual all the purposes for which the personal
information is collected at or before the time of collection.&quot; The
obligation on the part of the firm will vary depending on the
circumstances and type of information being collected. </p>
<p>The
Court also remarks that in complying with Principle 8, &quot;Openness,&quot;
which requires an organization to make available specific information
about its policies and practices relating to the management of personal
information may be the basis of a finding of ‘tacit consent&#39;, should it
be demonstrated that first time customers are aware of the brochures at
the time they subscribe.<a name="_ftnref30" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn30">[30]</a></p> <p>A
central theme of the &quot;Implementing PIPEDA: A review of Internet privacy
statements and on-line practices&quot; project has been the extent to which
companies are open about their privacy practices. Ideally, openness
should mirror knowledge and consent, but the reality is that an
information asymmetry exists between company and individual in a
depersonalized arrangement. The absence of a clear legal recourse makes
the need for organizations to provide information about their personal
information management practices far greater. Cavoukian has suggested
that consumers are &quot;far less willing to entrust their personal data to
organizations that, at a minimum, don&#39;t have a posted privacy
statement.&quot;<a name="_ftnref31" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn31">[31]</a></p> <p><strong>The
Role of the OPC</strong></p> <p>The
Office of the Privacy Commissioner has a clear policy making mandate to
promote privacy through the research and development of information
programs to foster public understanding on the subject of privacy as
well to encourage organizations to develop detailed policies and
practices, including organizational codes of practice to comply with
the PIPED Act.<a name="_ftnref32" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn32">[32]</a></p> <p>The
PIPED Act however seems to suggest that its role is both conciliatory
as well as adversarial when it comes to handling individual privacy
complaints and protecting privacy as a whole. </p> <p>In
practice it
would appear the OPC has a strategy of conciliation and confidentiality
with respect to the handling of individual complaints. This is entirely
appropriate, given the sensitive nature of the information to which the
Commissioner is privy. The OPC does, pursuant to the PIPED Act have the
discretion &quot;...to make public any information relating to the personal
information practices of an organization if the Commissioner considers
that it is in the public interest to do so.&quot; <a name="_ftnref33" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn33">[33]</a></p> <p>Toward the end of
its judgment, the Court remarks in <em>obiter </em><span style="font-style: normal;">that
the Office of the Privacy Commissioner &quot;...is not a tribunal and has no
decision-making power under the PIPED Act. At best, the Commissioner
can form an opinion on the issue and include it in his report.&quot;<a name="_ftnref34" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn34">[34]</a> Lawford has suggested
that this is tantamount to regarding case summaries as &quot;legally
worthless.<a name="_ftnref35" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn35">[35]</a>&quot;
This view perhaps fails to recognize that the Commissioner serves a
policy making function and has ability to issue policy statements,
opinions, or in this case findings. This flows from the executive
rather than judicial character of such bodies.</span></p>
<p>The
reluctance on the part of the Commissioner to exercise this power is to
some extent understandable in view of the fact that a practice
regularly naming respondents would compromise its mediation function.
However, naming can serve as a sanction for non-compliance as well as
an incentive to comply if the procedures which will result in
publication are clearly articulated with industry players. Suggested
criteria for this process could include the severity of the breach of
privacy to a given class, harm caused to the individual complainant as
well as failure to promptly implement recommendations. </p>
<p>At
present the practice of reporting case summaries with names removed
provides little assistance to individuals and practitioners attempting
to follow these issues as they evolve creating considerable uncertainty
and frustration, particularly for privacy advocates. </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p>The
<em>Englander v. Telus</em><span style="font-style: normal;">
decision is not a ‘David and Goliath&#39; story but rather an examination
of competing perspectives on issue of privacy. The case provides a good
illustration of the activist, corporate and centralist perspectives in
the privacy debate. All of these positions have intrinsic validity, but
fail to fully address the problem when taken individually. If nothing
else the </span><em>Englander</em><span style="font-style: normal;"> decision provides a context for
discussion on the issue of privacy with respect to these perspectives.
</span></p> <p>In
this context the PIPED Act is shown to suffer from an internal
contradiction as to purpose, attempting to satisfy the needs of both
industry and individuals. The case also illustrates the difficulties in
enshrining industry codes in law. This approach is understandable given
the fact the privacy value is not absolute and difficult to define.
However if we are to move beyond decisions based on ‘common-sense&#39; and
refine our understanding of what is meant by an expectation of privacy
and the harm that results from its loss, a willingness to cultivate the
jurisprudence in this area will be needed. The OPC can contribute to
this development if it is prepared to name respondents under prescribed
circumstances. This, it is submitted, would add greatly to privacy
discourse by providing a more substantive basis for discussion between
the activist and corporate viewpoints.<br />

<a name="_Toc102981827"> </a><p><a name="_Toc102981827"><strong>Introduction</strong></a></p>
<a name="_Toc102981827"> </a><p><a name="_Toc102981827">The Article 29 Data Protection Working Party
(&quot;Working Party&quot;) is an independent advisory body on data protection
and privacy.</a><a name="_ftnref37" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn37">[37]</a>
On January 19, 2005 the Working Party adopted Opinion 1/2005 on the
level of protection ensured in Canada for the transmission of PNR and
API from airlines (&quot;Opinion&quot;). The opinions of the Working Party are of
important significance given the European Commission&#39;s policy of
prohibiting the transfer of personal information to nations that fail
to ensure an adequate level of personal data protection.<a name="_ftnref38" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn38">[38]</a>
The opinions more generally provide valuable insights into European
data protection law and policy, which provided the international
context in which Canadian data protection legislation such as the PIPED
Act was born.<a name="_ftnref39" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn39">[39]</a>
This paper examines the online privacy statements of Air Canada,
WestJet, CanJet and Jetsgo in view of the conclusions reached in the
Opinion. It also considers the extent to which the statements
demonstrate the airlines&#39; compliance with the PIPED Act. </p>
<p>The Working Party Opinion on Protection for the Transmission
of API/PNR from Airlines </p> <p align="left">The
adoption of the Opinion follows negotiations between the European
Commission and Canada, which sought to resolve problems highlighted by
the Working Party in the opinion it issued on 11 February 2004,<a name="_ftnref40" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn40">[40]</a>
in which the Working Party concluded that compliance with the Canadian
requirements by the airlines at that time raised concerns in respect of
the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC. As a result of these
negotiations, the Working Party received a document dated January 18,
2005 containing Commitments by the Canada Border Services Agency
(&quot;CBSA&quot;) relating to the application of its PNR program.<a name="_ftnref41" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn41">[41]</a> The Opinion was
adopted in light of these Commitments. </p> <p align="left">In
the Opinion, the Working Party analyses the level of protection ensured
by Canada once airlines have transmitted API and PNR data relating to
their passengers and crew members to the CBSA. Under Canadian law, all
commercial carriers are required to provide the CBSA with API/PNR data
relating to all persons on board commercial conveyances bound for
Canada.<a name="_ftnref42" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn42">[42]</a>
API is basic information and includes the traveller&#39;s name, date of
birth, citizenship or nationality and passport or other travel document
data.<a name="_ftnref43" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn43">[43]</a>
PNR data is more detailed information, which includes the travel
itinerary, address and check-in information and is gathered by airlines
in their reservation, check-in and departure control systems.<a name="_ftnref44" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn44">[44]</a>
API/PNR data is used by the CBSA to identify persons who may be subject
to closer questioning or examination on arrival in Canada because of
their potential ties with terrorism. Based on its analysis, the Working
Party concluded that Canada ensures an adequate level of protection
with regard to the processing of API and PNR data transferred from
airlines to the CBSA in relation to flights concerning any person on
board a conveyance arriving in Canada.<a name="_ftnref45" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn45">[45]</a>
In reaching this conclusion, the Working Party identified several
components of the Commitments that reflect the European Commission&#39;s
policy that the legitimate requirements of air transport security and
internal security in Canada should not contradict fundamental rights of
privacy and data protection.<a name="_ftnref46" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn46">[46]</a> </p> <p align="left"><strong>Specific Commitments Endorsed by the
Working Party</strong></p> <p align="left"><span style="font-family: symbol;">·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
</span>The
Working Party welcomed section 7 of the Commitments, which states that
the Canadian Passenger Information System PAXIS has been configured to
receive API and PNR data ‘pushed&#39; from a carrier rather than
transferred through a ‘pull&#39; system. The Commitments also defined
narrowly the purposes for processing API/PNR data so as to maintain
balance in the approach to be taken in respect of fighting
terrorism.<a name="_ftnref47" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn47">[47]</a></p> <p align="left"><span style="font-family: symbol;">·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
</span>The
Working Party commended the Commitments insofar as they reduced the
number of data elements to be transferred to the Canadian authorities
from 38 (which the Working Party previously considered as going well
beyond what could be considered adequate, relevant and not excessive
for the purposes for which data is collected and/or further
processed),<a name="_ftnref48" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn48">[48]</a>
to 25, none of which contain sensitive personal data such as personal
information revealing racial or ethnic origin, and data concerning
health or sex life.<a name="_ftnref49" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn49">[49]</a> </p> <p align="left"><span style="font-family: symbol;">·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
</span>The
Commitments provided for the required retention period for data to be
reduced from 6 years to 3.5 years, and for the information to be
increasingly de-personalized during the 3.5 year period.<a name="_ftnref50" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn50">[50]</a> </p> <p align="left"><span style="font-family: symbol;">·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
</span>The
Commitments only allow for transfers of a minimum amount of data in
specific cases directly related to terrorism or terrorism-related
crimes, and in the case of transfers to other countries, the level of
data protection granted by the receiving country figures as one of the
criteria to be taken into account. <a name="_ftnref51" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn51">[51]</a>
In addition, only countries having received an adequacy finding under
the Directive, as well as EU Member States, are eligible to receive API
and PNR data retained in PAXIS (being data held on passengers who are
not the subject of an investigation in Canada).</p> <p align="left"><span style="font-family: symbol;">·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
</span>Finally,
s. 21 of the Commitments provides that the CBSA will provide
information to passengers relating to the collection of data and that
the CBSA is committed to administratively extending certain rights
under the Privacy Act to citizens who are not present in Canada,
including rights of access, correction and notation with regard to
personal information.<a name="_ftnref52" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn52">[52]</a>
Such an extension of the Privacy Act would bring the Act in line with
the international scheme of privacy protection that reaches over
borders. Indeed, the PIPED Act was implemented in light of threatened
restrictions on cross border-border data flows caused by the European
Directive. </p> <p>The above elements of the Canadian
API/PNR
program, as endorsed by the Working Party, may be taken to constitute
indicators of a balanced approach to information collection and sharing
for national security purposes. It is useful to consider these
components in assessing the privacy policies and practices of airlines
more generally. Whether or not airlines deal with personal information
in a manner consistent with the above Commitments commended in the
Working Party&#39;s opinion, will now be considered.</p>
<p>Airline Compliance with CBSA Commitments </p> <p align="left"><span style="font-weight: normal;">To
establish whether privacy policy and practice in the airline industry
is consistent with the Working Party&#39;s Opinion the web site privacy
policies of four Canadian based airlines: WestJet, CanJet, Air Canada,
and Jetsgo were reviewed.<a name="_ftnref53" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn53">[53]</a> </span></p> <p align="left">The Issue of ‘Push&#39; and ‘Pull&#39; </p> <p align="left"><span style="font-weight: normal;">A
‘pull&#39; system for transferring data is a system whereby airline
passengers&#39; data are directly accessed by the authorities concerned on
a continuous basis. A ‘push&#39; system, as adopted in the CBSA&#39;s
Commitments and welcomed by the Working Party, is a system whereby only
information submitted by the collecting airline may be received by the
CBSA. Under a ‘push&#39; system, access to personal data by Canadian
authorities is limited to only that which is necessary for the purpose
of fighting acts of terrorism. A ‘push&#39; system reflects the Working
Party&#39;s policy that the purposes for processing API/PNR data must bear
a clear relationship with fighting acts of terrorism, and that data
transferred must be adequate, relevant and not excessive. This policy
finds expression in Canadian law through s. 5(3), and Principles 4 and
5 of Schedule 1, of the PIPED Act. </span></p>
<p>Section 5(3) of
the PIPED Act provides that airlines may only collect, use, or disclose
personal information for purposes that a reasonable person would
consider appropriate in the circumstances.<strong>
</strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">What
is appropriate depends on consumer expectations of privacy in the air
travel industry. Increased security measures in the airline industry
since September 11 have arguably reduced air travellers&#39; expectations
of privacy. However, it is equally arguable that any collection, use,
and disclosure of personal information by an airline is appropriate if
it is necessary to facilitate the provision of air travel and other
services requested by the consumer, such as customer loyalty program
membership and marketing offers. </span></p> <p align="left"><span style="font-weight: normal;">While
the collection of personal information, such as name, address and other
contact details, is necessary for the purpose of facilitating air
travel and related requested services, the collection of particulars of
an individual&#39;s computer through &quot;cookies&quot; is arguably not. &quot;Personal
information&quot;, as defined in s. 2 of the PIPED Act, would appear to
include particulars of an individual&#39;s computer collected through the
use of &quot;cookies&quot;. Cookies are small snippets of text code that are
placed on a user&#39;s computer by a website&#39;s server. They allow for a
greater personalization of a user&#39;s experience on the Internet. Air
Canada, CanJet, and WestJet acknowledge the use of cookies to observe
user preferences and track traffic patterns on their websites. Air
Canada also provides in its policy that it uses advanced &quot;cookie&quot;
technology in the form of &quot;Conversion Beacons&quot; (small, simple snippets
of HTML code) to track the activity of its subscribers and measure the
effectiveness of ads. Moreover, Air Canada&#39;s policy suggests that it
may be more difficult for consumers to book flights online if their
Internet security is set not to accept cookies. The extent to which the
collection of information about an individual&#39;s computer is necessary
for the purposes of facilitating air travel and other requested
services is questionable and arguably contrary to the reasonable
purpose requirement of s.&#160;5(3) and the policy of the ‘push&#39;
system
reflected in the CBSA&#39;s Commitments. </span></p> <p align="left"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Under
Principle 4 of Schedule 1 of the PIPED Act, organizations may only
collect personal information for the purposes identified, and should
avoid any blanket collection of information. Both WestJet and Air
Canada state in their policies that they limit collection of personal
information to that which is necessary to fulfil the stated purposes
for which the information is required. Jetsgo also specifies in its
policy that it &quot;does not gather any personal information for purposes
other than those expressly stipulated.&quot; In contrast, CanJet&#39;s policy
does not include any statement to the effect that collection is limited
to the purposes identified. It is therefore not certain from CanJet&#39;s
policy whether its information collection practices are limited to the
purposes stated. </span></p> <p align="left"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Under
Principle 5, personal information must only be used, disclosed and
retained to the extent necessary to fulfil the identified purposes.
This principle mirrors the CBSA requirement to only allow for transfers
of a minimum amount of data in terrorism&#8209;related cases. Air Canada
purports to comply with this policy by stating in its notice that &quot;Air
Canada will not use or disclose your personal information for purposes
other than those for which it was collected without your explicit
consent or as required by law.&quot; WestJet similarly purports to comply by
stating in its notice that its general policy is to limit the
collection, use and disclosure of personal information to the purposes
identified. Both WestJet and Air Canada qualify their policies by
informing consumers that personal information may be required by
security laws to be disclosed to legal authorities without consent. The
statements of CanJet and Jetsgo however, do not provide that use and
disclosure are limited to particular purposes. </span></p>
<p align="left">Data Retention Time</p> <p align="left"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The
retention policy of the CBSA, as outlined in ss. 8 and 9 of the
Commitments, requires data to be retained for 3.5 years and
increasingly anonymized. This policy is reflected in Principle 5 of the
PIPED Act, which requires personal information to be retained only to
the extent necessary to fulfil the identified purposes, and to be
destroyed, erased, or made anonymous once the need for it expires.
</span></p> <p align="left"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Air
Canada and WestJet provide in their policies that personal information
collected by them is retained only for the period necessary to fulfil
the purposes for which it was collected. These statements differ
significantly from those of CanJet and Jetsgo, which do not provide
that retention of personal information is limited to particular
purposes and therefore do not clearly delineate the airlines&#39; retention
practices. WestJet&#39;s policy was the only one to provide that when
personal information is no longer needed, it is securely destroyed or
made anonymous. The policies of Air Canada, Jetsgo, and CanJet failed
to mention procedures for the destruction of information that is no
longer required, leading one to question the existence of such
procedures.</span></p> <p>Data Disclosure/Onward
Transfers</p> <p align="left"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The
CBSA&#39;s onward transfer policy, which requires the level of data
protection granted by the receiving country to be one of the criteria
to be taken into account in deciding whether to disclose data to other
agencies, is also reflected in Principle 1 of the PIPED Act&#39;s Schedule
1. Principle 1 dictates that when an organization discloses personal
information to a third party, it must employ contractual or other means
to ensure that the privacy of the information is protected. Personal
information collected by airlines is regularly disclosed to third
parties, such as the CBSA and air travel service providers, all of whom
require passenger information to facilitate air travel services.
However, the existence of contractual arrangements to ensure the
continued protection of personal information transferred to such third
parties was only evident in Air Canada&#39;s policy. Air Canada&#39;s privacy
policy is Principle 1-compliant insofar as it specifies that it uses
&quot;contractual and other means to ensure that your personal information
is afforded protection that meets the requirements of the PIPED Act
whenever a third party agent is used to complete some or all of the
stages of processing necessary to complete your travel transaction or
for research or survey purposes.&quot;<a name="_ftnref54" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn54">[54]</a>
In contrast, WestJet does not refer to the existence or otherwise of
contractual arrangements with third parties to ensure the continued
protection of personal information transferred to them. Neither
CanJet<a name="_ftnref55" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn55">[55]</a> nor
Jetsgo<a name="_ftnref56" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn56">[56]</a>
referred to third party recipients of personal information, let alone
the means by which transferred information is protected in accordance
with the PIPED Act. </span></p> <p align="left">A
Passenger&#39;s Right to Information</p> <p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Section
21 of the Commitments, which states that the CBSA will provide
information to the travelling public regarding its information handling
policy and practice, finds is closely aligned with the &quot;openness&quot;
principle of the PIPED Act. Airlines are required under Principle 8 to
make information about their policies and procedures regarding personal
information readily available to individuals. There was significant
variation in the extent to which the airlines appeared to comply with
this requirement. While Air Canada and WestJet both provide reasonably
comprehensive and specific information about their privacy practices
and policies, CanJet and Jetsgo maintain policies that provide only
general information about their privacy practices. For example,
Jetsgo&#39;s policy states that personal information is collected for the
purpose of accurately processing flight bookings, but it does not
specify who the information may or may not be disclosed to, nor does it
specify how long the information may be held for. It thereby fails to
fully inform customers what they can expect to happen to their
information. </span></p> <p align="left"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The extent to which the policies
described the <em>uses</em></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">
to which personal information may be put also varied. WestJet provided
a comprehensive description of the manner in which personal information
would be collected and used, and the purposes of such uses. Air
Canada&#39;s policy also describes how and why information is collected and
used for certain specified purposes, such as arranging travel for
unaccompanied minors or persons with special needs, earning points in
frequent flyer programs, and signing up for email offers. The policy
also clearly states that it may be required by security laws to give
border control authorities access to passenger data. Thus, airline
customers are clearly informed that their information may be disclosed
to customs and immigration authorities of any country in their
itineraries. </span></p> <p align="left"><span style="font-weight: normal;">CanJet
and Jetsgo on the other hand specified in very basic terms the purposes
of information collection and the intended uses of such information.
CanJet&#39;s policy addresses disclosures required for national security
purposes by providing that information will not be disclosed without
the consent of the individual concerned, &quot;unless required by law.&quot;
Jetsgo&#39;s policy fails altogether to mention that it may be legally
required to disclose personal information without the consent of the
individual concerned. Such policies do not fully inform consumers of
the possible uses to which their information may be
put.</span></p> <p align="left">Passenger&#39;s Right of
Access, Correction and Notation</p> <p align="left"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Rights
of access, correction and notation with regard to personal information,
as provided in s. 29 of the Commitments, are similarly provided in
Principle 9 of the PIPED Act. Airlines are required by this principle
to inform an individual, on request, of the use, existence, or
disclosure of his or her personal information. An individual is
entitled to challenge the accuracy of information held by the airline,
and if the individual demonstrates the incorrectness or incompleteness
of his or her information, the airline must make the necessary
corrections.</span></p> <p align="left"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The
four policies in question differed in the manner in, and extent to
which, they appeared to provide access to personal information in the
relevant airline&#39;s possession. WestJet provides contact information
through which an individual may obtain access to one&#39;s personal
information, an opportunity to update that information and an account
of the use that has been made of it. The policy provides that requests
for information may be required to be in writing and must be
accompanied by sufficient information to allow the company to locate
the relevant information. Air Canada similarly acknowledges that
individuals have a right to access their personal information held by
Air Canada and provides a link through which personal information may
be accessed on its web site home page. The Air Canada policy also
provides instructions on how to access personal information on travel
bookings through the Air Canada Call Centre. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: normal;">In
contrast, CanJet provides no details in its policy about the procedure
for gaining access to and correction of personal information held by
it. A contact address is provided in the policy but no indication is
given as to the exact procedure (if any) for requesting and obtaining
access to personal information. Jetsgo appears to comply with this
requirement by expressly providing in its policy that customers have
the right to view any personal information it maintains as well as the
opportunity to change it or delete it &quot;if appropriate.&quot; It then
provides contact information through which an individual can obtain a
copy of his or her personal information. The different degrees to which
these policies indicate the existence of procedures for gaining access
to personal information suggest differences in the actual existence of
such procedures. </span></p> <p>Conclusion</p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Analysis
of airline privacy policy and practice, as evidenced from the online
privacy statements of four airlines, and as conducted in light of the
Article 29 Data Protection Working Party&#39;s Opinion, reveals an apparent
lack of uniformity in the approach taken by airlines to communicating
their information handling practices online. More specifically, the
online privacy statements of the two discount airlines (CanJet and
Jetsgo) fail to indicate the existence of procedures for handling
personal information, which is inconsistent with the balanced approach
to information collection and sharing required by the PIPED Act, and
reinforced in the Working Party&#39;s Opinion. Cultivating such a balanced
approach through the PIPED Act is difficult in view of the fact that
the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, which oversees the
implementation of the Act, has few traditional enforcement powers (such
as order-making powers and the ability to fine offenders).<a name="_ftnref57" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn57">[57]</a>
</span></p> <p align="left"><span style="font-weight: normal;">A
more accessible means of achieving this balance may be s. 18 of the
PIPED Act, which permits the Commissioner to audit businesses and
industries for systemic privacy violations. The Commissioner has yet to
conduct any such audit<a name="_ftnref58" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn58">[58]</a>
and given that the Commissioner has expressed little interest in
changing this position, consumer education through public education
initiatives is imperative to enforce airline compliance with the
policies reflected in the PIPED Act and the CBSA Commitments. If
consumers are informed by public education campaigns of their rights
under the PIPED Act, they will engage in communications with the
privacy officers of the companies they deal with. Such communication
will encourage airlines to self-audit, and to adopt a more balanced
approach to sharing API/PNR data, in a manner consistent with the
CBSA&#39;s Commitments and the Working Party&#39;s
Opinion.</span></p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The Article 29 Data Protection Working Party (&quot;Working Party&quot;)
is an independent advisory body on data protection and privacy.<a name="_ftnref59" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn59">[59]</a>
In November 2004 the Working Party adopted an opinion aimed at
harmonizing information provisions or organizations within EU member
states.<a name="_ftnref60" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn60">[60]</a>
The opinions of the Working Party are of particular concern in the
Canadian context however given the fact that the EU policy of
prohibiting the transference of personal data to nations failing to
ensure an adequate level of protection.<a name="_ftnref61" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn61">[61]</a></p> <p>The
adoption of this Opinion signals recognition that industry attempts at
communicating information management practices have been
unsatisfactory. This requirement of the communication of a company&#39;s
information management practices finds expression in Canadian law
through the Openness principle found in Schedule 1 of the PIPED
Act.<a name="_ftnref62" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn62">[62]</a></p>
<p>This
paper examines the online privacy notices of CIBC and Scotiabank in
relation to the Working Party Opinion. It also considers the notices of
these banks with respect to the PIPED Act. </p>
<p><strong>The Working Party Opinion on Information
Notices</strong></p> <p>The
Working Party Opinion on information notices seeks to encourage a
consistent approach to informing data subjects about their rights. This
approach it contends would ease compliance, improve awareness of data
protection rights and responsibilities and enhance the quality of
information on data protection.<a name="_ftnref63" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn63">[63]</a></p> <p>The
proposal is centred upon the comprehension of data subjects and
supports the concept of the multi-layered notice format, calling for
the acceptance of such notices as constituting legal compliance.<a name="_ftnref64" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn64">[64]</a></p>
<p>The
Opinion contends that the information provided to data subjects should
be in a language and layout that is easy to understand and is
appropriate for a given audience (e.g. children). The use of multiple
layers it is argued, will assist with the quality of information that
is provided, better focusing a data subject&#39;s query. Taken in sum, this
would be taken as acceptable at law. </p> <p>The Opinion
proposes
three layers in the notice. The first layer, called the &quot;short notice&quot;,
would provide individuals with ‘essential&#39; information namely the
identity of the privacy officer (or data controller) and the purposes
of processing (except where readily apparent). The Opinion is forward
in its thinking suggesting deployment of ‘very short notices&#39; in the
case of mobile phones and uses of pictograms where appropriate.<a name="_ftnref65" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn65">[65]</a> </p>
<p>The
second layer called the condensed notice would include relevant
information as required under the EU Data Protection Directive.<a name="_ftnref66" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn66">[66]</a> This is taken to
include:</p> <p><span style="font-family: symbol;">·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
</span>The name of the company</p> <p><span style="font-family: symbol;">·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
</span>The purpose of the data processing</p>
<p><span style="font-family: symbol;">·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
</span>The recipients or categories of recipients of the
data</p> <p><span style="font-family: symbol;">·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
</span>Whether replies to the questions are obligatory or
voluntary, as well as the possible consequences of failure to
reply</p> <p><span style="font-family: symbol;">·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
</span>The possibility of transfer to third parties</p>
<p><span style="font-family: symbol;">·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
</span>The right to access, to rectify and oppose</p>
<p><span style="font-family: symbol;">·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
</span>Choices available to the individual.</p>
<p>The third and last layer of the information notice would
include national legal requirements and specificities.<a name="_ftnref67" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn67">[67]</a>
While the last layer of is of no application in the Canadian context,
the short and condensed notice may be used as a marker for assessing
the on-line privacy notices of Canadian companies. The banking sector
is a useful industry for the purpose of this analysis as it is an
industry sector purporting to have the highest standards with respect
to privacy and a business model based on trust. </p>
<p><strong>The PIPED Act and Banking</strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span></p> <p>As
a federally regulated industry the PIPED Act has been of application to
the banking sector since its entry into force. The Canadian banking
industry consists of 19 domestic banks, 29 foreign bank subsidiaries
and 22 foreign bank branches across Canada. These institutions total
$1.8 trillion in assets. The customers of the banks number in the
millions including individuals, small- and medium-sized businesses,
large corporations, governments, institutional investors and non-profit
organizations.<a name="_ftnref68" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn68">[68]</a></p> <p>Banks
collect personal information regarding the identity of their customers
such as name, address and contact information. In addition, banks also
retain sensitive financial information about their customers such as
accounts they own, their savings, investments, credit, and debts and
even people&#39;s social insurance numbers (&quot;SINs&quot;) that they collect for
income reporting purposes. </p> <p>At common law, banks are
bound by
fiduciary obligations owed to their customers. These duties are no
doubt part of the reason that the banking industry was among the first
industries to go beyond a statement of principles and develop a
comprehensive privacy code of conduct in 1986. This code was updated
regularly in keeping with the changing requirements of the customers&#39;
privacy needs. In fact, many of the principles in the banks&#39; privacy
codes translated directly to the principles of the PIPED Act.</p>
<p>After
the implementation of the PIPED Act, there was little noticeable change
to the procedures of the banks, as the PIPED Act&#39;s guiding principles
were already reflected in the voluntary codes that the banks had
already been following.<a name="_ftnref69" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn69">[69]</a> </p>
<p><strong>Findings of the Office of the Privacy
Commissioner</strong></p> <p>Given
the culture of respect in the banking industry for privacy, one would
have expected little or no complaints under the PIPED Act to the Office
of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC). However, banks were the respondents
in 118 findings out of the 255 made up to January 1, 2004, representing
46% of the findings. These findings dealt with improper account access,
use and disclosure, secondary marketing, over collection of personal
information, income reporting questions, security problems, access
problems, credit reporting and SIN usage.<a name="_ftnref70" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn70">[70]</a> </p> <p>For example in
PIPED Act Case Summary #46,<a name="_ftnref71" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn71">[71]</a>
a bank was accused of inappropriately demanding birth dates from
applicants. The customer claimed that the bank required inappropriate
information - her birth date - when she tried to open an account over
the phone. When she inquired about the use of the birth-date, the
representative over the phone told her that it was needed for income
reporting purposes. Dissatisfied with the answer, she raised her
concern to a bank supervisor, who informed her that the birth-date was
indeed required, though not for income reporting purposes, but as
identification information when the customer subsequently contacted the
bank. The customer objected to this, stating that the bank already had
other information such as the SIN, and should not be collecting
information that could be used for demographic identification. The
commissioner found that the bank was in violation of Principle 4.3
which states that the organization should collect solely the
information that was required for the stated purpose, and felt that the
bank had enough information to identify the customer without having to
collect information. The bank was also found to be in violation of
section 5(3) which states that the organization may collect, use or
disclose information for only those purposes that a reasonable person
would consider appropriate. </p> <p>In case summary
#105,<a name="_ftnref72" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn72">[72]</a>
a customer objected to the bank&#39;s use of the SIN for credit card
activation. Banks collect the SIN number in compliance with the Canada
Customs and Revenue Agency&#39;s income reporting requirements. The bank
had collected the SIN information when the customer had opened an
interest bearing account. The customer felt that the SIN data should
not be shared between the databases for the two accounts. And that by
using the SIN as identification for credit card activation, the bank
was using information for a purpose not previously defined. The
Commissioner found the bank in violation of Principle 4.2.4 for not
informing the customer of the intended use of the SIN and not gaining
the customer&#39;s consent. The bank was also found to be in violation of
principle 4.3.2 for not making reasonable effort in informing the
customer of the new intended use of the SIN and in violation of
Principle 4.5 for using the SIN data for a purpose not previously
identified and without the customer&#39;s consent.</p> <p>The
OPC makes
available the findings of PIPED Act complaints on its web-site, however
there are still limitations to the kind of information that can be
obtained. The names of all parties in the case are withheld. Therefore,
on reading the cases, one does not know which banks were involved, and
subsequently, it is difficult to gauge if the recommendations made by
the commissioner have been followed. In some cases, the wording in the
privacy policy suggests that changes were made based on the findings of
a particular case.<a name="_ftnref73" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn73">[73]</a> </p> <p>The
PIPED Act is modeled on a complaint driven process. It is up to the
aggrieved consumer that feels his or her privacy has been violated to
bring the case to the attention of the OPC for investigation. This in
large part is dependent on the wherewithal of the individual consumer.
The number of complaints is therefore unlikely to be in line with the
number of actual breaches of privacy taking place in this industry
sector.</p> <p><strong>Privacy Statements: Short and
Condensed Information Notices</strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span></p> <p>In
light of the difficulties consumers have vindicating their rights, the
EU policy on information notices would appear to be a departure from
the consent model of privacy.<a name="_ftnref74" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn74">[74]</a>
A comparison of the privacy notices of CIBC and Scotiabank would tend
to suggest that Scotiabank is more aligned than CIBC with the position
of the Working Party. This is because the privacy policy of Scotiabank
follows a layered approach, with the bank&#39;s &quot;Privacy Code&quot;<a name="_ftnref75" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn75">[75]</a>
presented to the user in three layers, though the format does not
correspond to the Working Party&#39;s notion of a layered notice.
</p> <p>Scotiabank
provides a three-layered notice whereby the short notice provides an
overview of the scope of the code and a link to the Ten Principles of
the Code, as modeled on the Canadian Standard Association&#39;s (CSA) Model
Code for Protection of Personal Information. </p> <p>The
&quot;condensed&quot;
layer provides a brief definition of each of the ten principles of the
code. The next layer (obtained by clicking on the corresponding
principle) provides a detailed description of the corresponding
principle and Scotiabank&#39;s implementation of each principle. </p>
<p>CIBC&#39;s
Privacy Policy, by contrast, is in a long notice format, with the
complete privacy policy displayed on a single scrollable screen.
</p> <p><strong>Scotiabank&#39;s
Notice</strong></p> <p>The
requirements of the suggested Working Party short notice are that
information notices should provide information about the identity of
the data controller (privacy officer in the Canadian context) and the
purposes of processing. Additionally, there should be a clear
indication as to how the individual can access additional information.
While Scotiabank&#39;s Privacy Code does acknowledge the fact that senior
management of each Scotiabank Group Member is accountable for the data
that is collected, and that a person or persons who is responsible for
the overall privacy protection and compliance of the collected
information will be identified to the customer (Principle 1), it does
not explicitly provide the identity of this purpose in this document.
This information is, however, provided in the Privacy Brochure under
&quot;The Need for Security&quot; as the Secretary of the Privacy Committee,
along with a mailing address. </p> <p>The purposes for
which the
information is collected is provided under Principle 2 - Identifying
the Purposes for Collecting Personal Information. It states that the
information collected is limited to the following purposes: </p>
<ul> <li>To understand the customer&#39;s needs.</li>
<li>To analyze the suitability of products or services for the
customer.</li> <li>To determine the customer&#39;s eligibility
for products and services.</li> <li>To set up, manage and
offer products and services that meet the customer&#39;s needs.</li>
<li>To provide ongoing service.</li> <li>To meet
legal and regulatory requirements.</li> <li>With regards to
insurance products to investigate and adjudicate insurance
claims.</li> </ul> <p>No
information is provided on the exact nature of the information required
for any of these purposes, though the Privacy Code does state that the
purpose of use of the information will be provided to the customer at
the time the information is collected, and in a manner that the
customer will understand. The Scotiabank Group staff member will be
able to explain the purposes to the customer, who will be able to ask
for information about the uses. </p> <p>The Privacy Code
also states
that purposes that are not directly obvious will be explained to the
customer at the time of collection of the information. This includes
uses for references, SIN, credit information, medical information,
claims and insurance history, and information regarding accounts among
others. </p> <p>The Privacy Code further states that the
customer
can access the personal information that the bank holds upon &quot;written
request&quot;, and obtain a list of third parties to whom the information
has been disclosed (Principle 9). Policies and procedures are in place
to make this information available to the customer, and these policies
and procedures will be disclosed to the customer when requested. The
information provided to the customer will be as specific as possible in
terms of information on file, to whom the information has been
disclosed and when and how the information was disclosed. This
information will be provided to the customer free or at a cost
commensurate with the effort required to retrieve the information.
</p> <p>As
required by the suggested Working Party condensed layer, the Privacy
Code should provide the name of the company, the purposes of the data
processing, the recipients of the data, the reply mechanism,
possibility of transfer to third parties, possibility to rectify,
access and oppose information held by a company, and the choices
available to the individual. Additionally, information regarding
redress within the company or through the nearest data protection
agency must be provided. As such, throughout the privacy code, the
company is referred to as the Scotiabank Group Member. The definition
of Scotiabank Group Members is provided in the short notice as
&quot;companies engaged in the following services to the public: deposits,
loans and other personal financial services; credit, charge, debit and
payment card services; full-service and discount brokerage services;
mortgage loans; trust and custodial services; insurance services;
investment management and financial planning services; and mutual funds
investment services.&quot; Further, as collectors of customer personal
information, these Scotiabank Group Members are the recipients of the
information. </p> <p>The Privacy Code states that
Scotiabank will be
as specific as possible about where they obtained the information, to
whom the information was disclosed and how and when the information was
disclosed. This information will be obtained from the customer records
and will be presented to the customer in a form that will be easy for
the customer to understand, with explanations of abbreviations and
codes. The Privacy Code, however, does not specify what this form may
be. The reply will be made within a reasonable time, though this time
is not defined. The reply will also be made free to the user or at a
cost commensurate with the effort required to obtain the information.
In cases where a cost is to be incurred by the customer, the customer
will be informed of the possible charge with the option to withdraw the
request. </p> <p>If a request for information is denied,
the
customer will be informed of reasons of this decision, unless
prohibited by law. The customer can challenge this decision. The
customer may also challenge the reasonableness of the cost of providing
personal information. The complaint resolution process and the person
whom the customer needs to contact in such an event is part of the
procedures of Scotiabank (Principle 10). </p> <p>The
privacy code
however, does not provide any concrete information on this process or
contact information, implying that it is available to the customer in a
format easy to understand. The Privacy Code further states that the
Scotiabank Group Member will investigate all complaints that it finds
justified, and attempt to resolve it. If need be, changes will be made
to the policies and procedures to ensure that other customers are not
inconvenienced in the future. The customer is also encouraged to pursue
other resources if he is not satisfied with the way a complaint is
resolved. These different avenues are available to the customer through
the Scotiabank branch and are not provided in the Privacy Code. The
Privacy Code does state that the customer may file a written complaint
with the Federal Privacy Commissioner if he feels that the Scotiabank
Group Member&#39;s operations are not in compliance with the
code.</p> <p>The
Privacy Code states that the customer will be informed at the time of
collection, that his information may be passed on to other Scotiabank
Group Members or affiliates to market other products. The customer&#39;s
consent, however, is required for this, and the customer has the option
to withdraw consent (Principle 3). The Privacy Code also provides
information for cases where the customer&#39;s consent may not be obtained
before disclosing information to third parties. While Scotiabank
records most disclosures to third parties, the Privacy Code also
outlines situations in which disclosure of information to a third party
is not recorded in the customer&#39;s file. These include disclosing
information for routine maintenance such as cheque printing, reporting
to CCRA, updating of credit information, and underwriting or claims
processing. Nowhere in the Privacy Code are the third parties listed,
though the code does indicate that the customer could request the
information from Scotiabank.</p> <p>Customers are informed
that the
Scotiabank Group Member will keep personal information accurate and
current. The customer may challenge the bank in writing if any of his
information held by the bank is inaccurate or incomplete, and request
that the information be amended. The bank also relies on the customer
to keep certain information like contact data current. Scotiabank will
revise its inaccurate information and inform all third parties that
could use this information. The customer is also given the option to
challenge the bank if it refuses to amend the incorrect information
that it holds. </p> <p><strong>CIBC&#39;s
Notice</strong></p> <p>CIBC&#39;s privacy notice does not
follow a layered format.<a name="_ftnref76" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn76">[76]</a>
The policy is presented on a single, scrollable screen. The requisite
information is provided without the need for embedded weblinks.
Discussion of CIBC&#39;s privacy policy is therefore done in relation to
the actual content of the policy, rather than the layered property of
the notice.</p> <p>The purposes for data collection are
stated as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Establish your
identification;</li> <li>Protect you and us from error and
fraud;</li> <li>Understand your needs and eligibility for
products and services;</li> <li>Recommend particular
products and services to meet your needs;</li> <li>Provide
ongoing service; and</li> <li>Comply with legal
requirements.</li> </ul> <p>These
purposes are broadly defined and do not mention the kinds of
information required. The special case of the SIN is illustrated as
required for tax reporting purposes, and can be used - with the consent
of the customer - for identification purposes.</p> <p>The
privacy
brochure broadly defines other recipients of the customer&#39;s information
as outside companies that may be used to process the data, and a court
of law, or other regulatory authority for legal reasons. It is also
stated that information will be shared within the CIBC group, as
permitted by law. No other recipients or categories of recipients are
identified. </p> <p>The CIBC privacy policy also states
that the
customer&#39;s consent will be obtained before information about him is
collected or used. Certain cases are explicitly specified such as
checking employment, obtaining a credit report, offering products and
services and making it available (subject to legal restrictions), to
other CIBC groups. </p> <p>Consent is also obtained before
collecting the SIN. The policy also states that consent can be implied
or explicit, and the customer can withdraw consent after he has given
it. Special mention is made with regards to credit reporting - the
customer cannot withdraw consent to allow the bank to update the credit
bureau as long as the customer has credit with the bank. </p>
<p>The
policy also provides that if the customer does not provide consent for
the collection and use of certain information, the bank will not be
able to provide certain products and services to the customer. While
these situations are not explicitly described in the policy, it does
state that the customer will be advised at the time of collection of
the information. The customer can also withdraw consent from receiving
direct marketing material, but this does not limit the information that
the customer receives with their monthly statement or in discussions
with the personal banker or customer service representative. </p>
<p>In
addition the CIBC Privacy policy explicitly states that the customer&#39;s
consent is obtained before sharing information with third parties. This
includes all subsidiaries within the CIBC group. The policy mentions
outside companies that provide the expertise to process the
information, information that is released to third parties for legal
reasons and in circumstances to protect the interests of CIBC. While
the policy assures the customer of the standards employed while
ensuring the security of the information, the policy does not
explicitly identify companies or organizations to which information
could be disclosed. </p> <p>The customer is informed that
he can
access his information and verify its accuracy. This request may be
asked to be put in writing. The policy also states that certain
information may not be made available to the customer, but does not
elaborate on what types of information are covered. </p>
<p>The
customer can also request the names of persons and companies that the
bank had shared the customer&#39;s information with. However, this does not
include third party companies that do work for the banks like cheque
printers, or T5 reports to Revenue Canada or regular updates to the
credit bureau. All requests will be responded to within 30 days, with
explanations provided for delays, if any. CIBC will also correct any
information that the customer feels is inaccurate. If the bank has
obtained incorrect information from a credit bureau, the bank will
provide the customer with the contact information of the concerned
party so that the customer may have his or her information corrected.
</p> <p>The
customer is also provided information on how to make complaint. Three
steps are provided - talking to the bank directly, contacting customer
service and contacting the ombudsman of the bank.</p>
<p>While both
banks provide the customer with information on how the data is
collected and used, the form of presentation and content of this
information is not, at present, in compliance with the Working Party
requirements for information notices. </p>
<p><strong>Implementing Layered
Notices</strong></p> <p>Online
privacy notices differ vastly between different companies, even those
in the same sector. Scotiabank and CIBC are both major players in the
Canadian banking sector yet their approach to informing their customers
about their information rights varies greatly. These notices are in
themselves difficult for the customer to grapple with. Furthermore, it
is difficult for the customer to make comparisons between notices of
the different banks, to assess the information practices of the
different companies. This is largely due to the difference in use of
language, amount of information presented to the customer, and the way
this information is structured.</p> <p>The Working Party
proposes
that the language and layout used in online information notices should
be simple to understand and geared toward the target audience. The
proposal also stresses multi-layered formats for simplicity and
consistency in information notices. The adoption of such a proposal in
the banking sector would mean that online information notices would be
consistent enough with each other to allow customers to do a quick and
easy comparison of the banks&#39; practices. If all banks, and other
industries, followed the same format, they arguably would lead to an
increase in customers&#39; awareness of their data protection rights as
they see certain types of information regarding their data repeated in
different company notices. In addition this practice would force
companies to play by an agreed set of rules with respect to how an
organization&#39;s information management practices are communicated to the
public.</p> <p>With information provided to the customer in
multiple
layers, allowing the customer to control the amount of information he
needs, the online information notices would appear less intimidating
and daunting, and would encourage customers to study the more important
and relevant details of notice. </p> <p>For layered notices
to be
most effective, the banking industry needs to arrive at a common
template. Most banks collect the same types of information, and use
them for the same purposes. However, there may be differences with
respect to how the banks handle the processing of their customers&#39;
information and disclosure of information within their subsidiary
groups. While a comparison of the information notices of these banks
should make these differences apparent, the layered notice template
that is used needs to be flexible enough to allow for this. As has been
seen by the examples of the two banks, the purposes of data collection
as reported to the customer tend to differ, even though both banks
provide the same services to their customers. </p> <p>A
consistent
format for reporting purposes of collection will need to be developed
that provides the customer with enough information on why the banks
collect information. The question of understandable language is
subjective, and needs to be addressed so that all banks are consistent.
This would make it easier for the customers to distinguish between the
practices of different banks. </p> <p>The information
required of
the different layers as suggested by the proposal would need to be
revised when applied to the information notices of the banking industry
in Canada.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p>In
the case of banks the
PIPED Act Openness principle suggests that organizations should be
forthcoming about their procedures and policies with respect to how
information is collected, used and disclosed. Companies give effect to
this provision through a mixed array of brochures, fine print on
application forms and online notices. This puts the organization in the
position of educator and adversary since there are instances where
disclosure will not be in the company&#39;s best interest or the customer
wishes to hold the organization accountable for failing to honour its
commitments. </p> <p>The Working Party proposal on
information
notices would consolidate the process of disseminating information
about its information management practices as well as provide the banks
with a consistent means of implementing the PIPED Act Openness
principle in the online context.</p> <p>By providing the
banks with
guidelines on how relevant information needs to be presented to
customers, it removes some of the decision making process from the bank
itself, making it easier to formulate an understandable privacy notice.
As such, the Working Party proposal serves as a good complement to the
Openness principle in educating customers about their privacy
rights.<br />

prevents the transmission of any personal information outside of the
European Union unless the recipient country has legislation in place
that would offer substantially similar protections: see Directive

Privacy Statements in the Retail Sector&quot;</a></h1>
<p>by Aniz Alani</p> <p>The
purpose of this report is to examine issues concerning the protection
of personal information within the retail business sector in Canada
and, in particular, the extent to which retail businesses&#39; web site
privacy statements address these concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>As
of January 1, 2004, the PIPED Act purports to apply to virtually all
organizations engaging in commercial activity, including retail
businesses carrying on businesses entirely within a single province.
The PIPED Act does not apply, however, in provinces where
&quot;substantially similar&quot; legislation has been enacted. British Columbia,
Alberta, and Quebec have passed substantially similar privacy statutes.
The PIPED Act continues to apply, however, in all cases where personal
information is transferred outside of a province.</p>
<p>For
the purpose of this report, &quot;retail business&quot; includes any organization
which engages in the sale of commodities or goods to an ultimate
consumer. </p> <p>It is noteworthy that the PIPED Act
does not distinguish between industry sectors except to the extent that
some sectors, such as airlines, banking, and telecommunications, are
considered to be federal works and undertakings. The federally
regulated industry sectors are clearly within the legislative
jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada under s. 92(10) of the
<em>Constitution Act, 1867</em>.<a name="_ftnref77" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn77">[77]</a>
The application of the PIPED Act to the retail sector has been
particularly controversial because, unlike federal works, businesses
and undertakings, retail businesses operating entirely within a
province are governed by provincial legislation with respect to
&quot;property and civil rights&quot; under s. 92(13) of the
<em>Constitution Act, 1867</em>.</p> <p>The
Government of Canada has very clearly expressed its view that the PIPED
Act is a valid exercise of Parliament&#39;s legislative jurisdiction in
areas of trade and commerce under s. 91(2). Former Minister of Industry
John Manley made the following remarks in the House of Commons with
respect to jurisdiction over the PIPED Act:</p> <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The
bill is a legitimate exercise of the federal government&#39;s authority to
legislate in respect of trade and commerce in Canada. The increasing
ubiquity of networks and the speed of the technology means more
companies are collecting more information, circulating it more widely
and combining it more ingeniously than ever before.<a name="_ftnref78" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn78">[78]</a></span></p> <p>In
order to ground the PIPED Act as a valid exercise of Parliament&#39;s
authority over trade and commerce, specifically in areas otherwise
falling within provincial jurisdiction, the following five conditions
must be satisfied: (1) it is part of a general regulatory scheme; (2)
the scheme must be monitored by the continuing oversight of a
regulatory agency; (3) the legislation must be concerned with trade as
a whole rather than with a particular industry; (4) the legislation
should be of a nature that the provinces jointly or severally would be
constitutionally incapable of enacting; and (5) the failure to include
one or more provinces or localities in a legislative scheme would
jeopardize the successful operation of the scheme in other parts of the
country.<a name="_ftnref79" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn79">[79]</a></p> <p>The
constitutional validity of the PIPED Act, specifically whether it
represents a valid exercise of Parliament&#39;s authority under the general
trade and commerce power, has been challenged by the Government of
Quebec. A reference question on this issue has been submitted to the
Quebec Court of Appeal.</p> <p>Without addressing the
merits of the constitutional arguments in any depth, it is noteworthy
that one of the five requirements under the general trade and commerce
power under <em>General Motors of Canada Ltd. </em><span style="font-style: normal;">v. </span><em>City National
Leasing</em><span style="font-style: normal;"> is that the
legislation be
concerned with trade as a whole rather than with a particular industry.
Because the legislation cannot be industry-specific, there is very
little opportunity for </span><em>the PIPED </em>Act
to provide for significant exceptions in terms of the organizations to
which it applies. </p> <p>The
PIPED Act does not distinguish between small businesses and larger
chain operations. Instead, it imposes positive privacy obligations on
all organizations conducting commercial activity in Canada. Despite the
economic reality which makes it more difficult for an independent
retailer than a large retail chain store to learn its obligations about
the PIPED Act, devise a privacy policy, implement suitable privacy
practices, and develop an infrastructure for responding to customer
access
and correction requests or complaints, the PIPED Act appears to impose
the same duty on each indiscriminately. Instead, every commercial
organization, regardless of its age or size, is required under the
PIPED Act to comply with specific positive obligations. Although this
study focused on companies with privacy statements posted on their
Internet websites - incidentally, a subset of commercial organizations
which enjoys relative expertise and sophistication vis-à-vis
independent small business owners - there is an apparent vacuum of
privacy knowledge and awareness at the level of small business. If the
protection of personal information is, as stated, the purpose at which
the PIPED Act is aimed, additional steps must be taken to ensure the
PIPED Act is enforced broadly across all organizations which
purportedly fall under its application. If the PIPED Act were only
taken seriously by or in respect of relatively large commercial
organizations, the federal government would likely lose its claim to
jurisdiction under the general trade and commerce power since it would
no longer concern trade as a whole. Privacy itself is arguably a matter
of property and civil rights and thus an issue of provincial
jurisdiction. It is only by addressing privacy as a general trade issue
that the federal government has been able to assert jurisdiction over
privacy protection. The alternative argument, which is not explored in
this paper, is that the protection of personal information is a matter
of national concern and thus a valid exercise of Parliament&#39;s
jurisdiction to legislate for the &quot;peace, order and good government of
Canada&quot; under s. 91.</p> <p>Until the federalism issues
have been definitively resolved by the courts, consumers and businesses
must be familiar with applicable privacy legislation at both the
federal and provincial level. Of possible interest for future research
is the manner in which businesses operating in multiple jurisdictions
have adapted their privacy statements and practices to comply with
issues of overlapping jurisdiction.</p>
<p><strong>Methodology</strong></p> <p>In
order to acquire information about retail organizations&#39; privacy
practices, I contacted 19 companies by
e-mail, inviting the privacy manager at each company to participate in
our privacy study. A comprehensive questionnaire was prepared, which
was intended to solicit generally objective indicators of companies&#39;
privacy practices. As part of the invitation process, I selected 19
retail organizations with internet websites. I then located the e-mail
address listed for each company&#39;s privacy manager, and submitted a
standard form invitation letter to the address.</p>
<p><strong>Companies Contacted</strong></p>
<p>The
following 19 companies were contacted with requests to participate in
our study: Future Shop, RadioShack Canada, Staples, Office Depot,
Indigo, Hudson Bay Company, Holt Renfrew, eBay, London Drugs, Black&#39;s
Photography, CanadaFlowers.com, Pizza Pizza, CanadaHelps.org, The
Shopping Channel, Henry&#39;s, Starbucks, Tim Horton&#39;s, McDonald&#39;s
Restaurants of Canada, and Subway.</p>
<p><strong>Responses</strong></p> <p>Of
the 19 companies contacted, the following 5 companies responded by
e-mail expressly declining to participate in our study: Indigo, London
Drugs, Radio Shack, Future Shop, and Black&#39;s Photography. Only one
company, McDonald&#39;s Restaurants of Canada, agreed to participate in the
study. The 13 remaining companies did not respond to the invitation in
any manner.</p> <p><strong>Role of the Privacy
Statement Within Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>Although
a focus of this privacy study was to examine retail businesses&#39; privacy
policies as published on internet websites, it is clear that a website
privacy statement forms only a part of a company&#39;s overall privacy
policy. Essentially, a website privacy statement describes a company&#39;s
general policy with respect to its use, collection and disclosure of
personal information within the course of its commercial activity. As
described below, the language of website privacy statements is
typically vague, leaving a reader with very little information about a
company&#39;s privacy policy beyond what is already generally provided
under the PIPED Act. Of far greater use to consumers is a company&#39;s
detailed implementation manual, which typically describes specific
examples of when a business practice engages a privacy interest and is
affected by the company&#39;s obligations under the PIPED Act.</p>
<p>As
part of my interview with McDonald&#39;s, I had the benefit of reviewing an
implementation handbook prepared for internal use by McDonald&#39;s
Restaurants of Canada Ltd. The handbook contains an itemized
explanation of the company&#39;s privacy principles (mirroring those
recognized in the PIPED Act) and a description of how each privacy
principle is reflected in the day-to-day operations. Also included are
hypothetical fact patterns describing situations in which privacy
obligations may operate and how a store manager or employee might
respond to the situation within the spirit of the company&#39;s privacy
policy. </p> <p>The level of detail included in the
implementation handbook is certainly in contrast to the level of
abstraction used generally in published privacy statements. By making
this observation I do not intend to discourage the use of broad privacy
statements. Indeed, privacy statements serve a useful purpose insofar
as they generally inform readers about a company&#39;s macro-level
commitment to privacy protection and compliance with the PIPED Act.
Instead I suggest that companies be encouraged to publish or make
available handbooks or implementation guides similar in scope to the
operational manuals published by government with respect to
administrative procedures for access to information legislation.<a name="_ftnref80" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn80">[80]</a></p>
<p>The
PIPED Act requires that &quot;organizations shall be open about their
policies and practices with respect to the management of personal
information. Individuals shall be able to acquire information about an
organization&#39;s policies and practices without unreasonable effort. This
information shall be made available in a form that is generally
understandable.&quot;<a name="_ftnref81" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn81">[81]</a>
The Act further provides that the information made available shall
include &quot;a copy of any brochures or other information that explain the
organization&#39;s policies, standards or codes.&quot;<a name="_ftnref82" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn82">[82]</a></p> <p>Relying
on this provision, an individual may request a company to provide a
detailed implementation guide setting out the recommended practices or
policies with respect to specific examples of personal information use
by the particular company. However, companies would be understandably
reluctant to provide this information for two main reasons. </p>
<p>First,
the preparation of a detailed implementation guide represents a
significant investment by the company of its time and resources.
Sharing this information with the public may be seen to deprive the
company of an acquired competitive advantage over another company which
has not made the same investment. </p> <p>Second, the
publication of specific practice recommendations may be seen to expose
a company to increased liability arising out of legal obligations
created not by the PIPED Act but by the representations in the
publication itself. Adopting this rationale, a company would be well
advised to limit its publicly available policy statements so as to
minimize the creation of any obligations not already imposed by the
PIPED Act. While this concern would appreciably explain the typically
vague language used in published privacy statements, it does little to
assuage individuals&#39; concerns about what specific steps a company is
taking to protect individual privacy. If the privacy policy equates to
confirming minimal compliance with the PIPED Act, there is arguably
less benefit to requiring each company to publish a broadly worded
privacy statement since the reader can otherwise assume the company is
aware of and intends to comply with its general obligations under the
PIPED Act.</p> <p><strong>Specific Privacy
Considerations in the Retail Sector</strong></p>
<p>In
this part, the means by which retail businesses typically collect and
use personal information will be reviewed. Where these means are used,
a company should specifically address them in a publicly available
privacy policy. The alternative to specifically referring to each is to
leave the consumer uncertain as to whether the company has recognized
the information collection as one which engages a privacy interest.
</p> <p><strong>Customer Feedback/Complaint
Forms</strong></p> <p>For
some retail organizations in which the exchange of personal
information is not necessary to complete a transaction, the collection
and use of customer feedback forms may form a significant proportion of
a company&#39;s personal information inventory. Customer feedback forms
typically invite consumers
to rate their level of satisfaction with their shopping experience in a
number of specific areas. Where the consumer requests that the company
respond to the feedback, the consumer is invited to provide his or her
contact information. In such cases, the exchange of personal
information is clearly voluntary as the consumer&#39;s knowledge and
consent of the collection and use is apparent when the feedback form is
completed. A lingering privacy concern, however, exists with respect to
the purposes for which the personal information is subsequently used
and disclosed. </p> <p>While
all privacy statements examined during this study contained language
restricting the use or disclosure of personal information for purposes
other than those for which the information was collected, the typical
absence of specific examples mentioned in privacy statements leaves the
reader to assume that the company and the reader share identical views
on which exchanges of personal information are governed by the privacy
policy or applicable privacy legislation. </p>
<p>McDonald&#39;s
specifically identifies the use of customer feedback forms and
addresses the various privacy interests engaged by their use. For
example, the McDonald&#39;s privacy principles speak to the use,
disclosure, accuracy and security of personal information provided in
customer feedback forums. Other companies&#39; privacy policies, including
companies known to use customer feedback forms, do not specifically
address how the personal information contained in these forms will be
used or disclosed by the collecting company. </p> <p>To the
extent
that a company actively invites consumers to provide feedback on the
company&#39;s performance, the company&#39;s privacy policy should specifically
address the limited purpose for which the information contained on the
customer feedback form will be used by the company, as well as how the
information will be stored, disclosed, and disposed of when it is no
longer needed.<a name="_Toc103387389" /></p>
<a name="_Toc103387389"> </a><p><a name="_Toc103387389"><strong>Returned
Merchandise</strong></a></p>
<a name="_Toc103387389"> </a><p><a name="_Toc103387389">Retail
businesses should review in-store return policies in light of privacy
legislation. When a customer attempts to return merchandise to obtain a
refund or exchange in accordance with a store&#39;s return policy, it is
still the case that the customer is asked for identifying personal
information as part of the return process. A customer&#39;s contact
information is reasonably related to the return process since the
company may need to contact the customer in case the returned product
has suffered undisclosed damage disqualifying the product for a refund

under the store&#39;s return policy. Personal information would not be
necessary for this purpose, however, if the clerk processing the return
performs an adequate inspection of the returned merchandise in the
presence of the customer.</a></p>
<a name="_Toc103387389"> </a><p><a name="_Toc103387389">Where a
company routinely requests a customer&#39;s contact or other personal
information as part of its return policy, what is the effect of a
customer&#39;s refusal to consent to the exchange of this personal
information? Since &quot;an organization shall not, as a condition of the
supply of a product or service, require an individual to consent to the
collection, use, or disclosure of information beyond that required to
fulfill the explicitly specified, and legitimate
purposes&quot;,</a><a name="_ftnref83" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn83">[83]</a>
it is doubtful an organization can refuse to provide a refund or
exchange where a customer reasonably withholds consent to providing the
requested personal information. If the store&#39;s purpose is indeed to
retain contact information in case there is a latent problem with the
returned merchandise, this purpose should be made expressly clear to
the customer at the time of the return. Moreover, the retention of the
customer&#39;s contact information, along with any additional information
including the reasons provided by the customer for returning the
product, should only be kept by the company for a reasonably brief
period of time sufficient to discover any undisclosed problems with due
diligence. This recommendation is not intended to create a limitation
period for nefarious individuals attempting to obtain a refund for
illegitimate purpose, but rather to reflect the reality that retail
businesses ordinarily do not collect or retain identifying information
about an individual when he or she
<em>purchases</em><span style="font-style: normal;">

Draws</strong></a></p>
<a name="_Toc103387390"> </a><p><a name="_Toc103387390">A common
marketing technique used in retail organizations is to offer customers
a contest awarding free products. Customers enter by providing a
business card or completing an entry form requesting contact
information. The ostensible purpose for collecting the personal
information as part of such contests, and accordingly the grounds on
which consent may be implied under principle 4.3.7, is to allow the
collecting organization to contact the winner to make prize
arrangements. Once the information has been collected, however, the
collecting organization has obtained contact information from its
clientele. </a></p>
<a name="_Toc103387390"> </a><p><a name="_Toc103387390">Determining
the purposes for which the organization may legitimately use this
information, assuming an express statement of purpose was not included
on the entry form, depends on what a reasonable person would consider
appropriate at the time of collection. If a company intends to
subsequently use the collected information for marketing purposes, the
company should expressly state such purpose at the time of collection.
</a></p>
<a name="_Toc103387390"> </a><p><a name="_Toc103387390">In the
context of company websites, consumers are often offered opportunities
to enter contests which require the collection of personal
information.</a><a name="_Toc103387390"> In addition
to the entrant&#39;s contact information, the entry form may request
additional information concerning the entrant&#39;s shopping preferences,
income and education levels, and other information not necessary to
administer the contest itself. </a></p>
<a name="_Toc103387390"> </a><p><a name="_Toc103387390">An example of an effective privacy statement
with respect to contests and surveys is found in Future Shop&#39;s privacy
policy:</a></p>
<a name="_Toc103387390"> </a><p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><a name="_Toc103387390"><strong>Participate in a Contest,
Promotion, or Survey</strong></a></span></p>
<a name="_Toc103387390"> </a><p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><a name="_Toc103387390">From
time to time, we may run contests, promotions, or surveys. If you
participate, you may be asked for contact information as well as
additional optional survey information (for example, product
preferences). Information from contest entries will be used to contact
you if you win. We may also summarize survey information in a manner
that no longer identifies the contest entrants for analysis, but will
not share personal information from entries. All contests are subject
to rules that will be available with each particular
contest.</a><a name="_ftnref84" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn84">[84]</a></span></p>
<p><a name="_Toc103387391"><strong>Rebate
Forms</strong></a></p> <p>Occasionally,
a retail store selling a product which includes a manufacturer&#39;s rebate
will offer to process and submit the rebate forms necessary to receive
the rebate amount. In such cases, the retail store will necessarily
collect personal information from the consumer including a mailing
address and other details concerning the purchase. In such cases, the
retail store is obliged not to use or disclose the collected personal
information for any purpose other than for processing the customer&#39;s
rebate claim. Since the information is no longer necessary for this
purpose once the claim has been submitted to the manufacturer offering
the rebate, the store&#39;s policy should provide for the timely and secure
destruction of the rebate information. </p> <p>An example
of a privacy policy statement with respect to rebate programs is found
on the Future Shop website: </p> <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Rebates</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Many
of the products you purchase through Future Shop are offered with
rebates. To claim your rebate, you will usually be asked to provide
your name, address, e-mail address and proof of purchase. You may also
be asked by either Future Shop or the vendor to provide your consent to
be added to promotional mailings and newsletters. Your consent is not a
condition of receiving the rebate.<a name="_ftnref85" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn85">[85]</a></span></p>
<p><a name="_Toc103387392"><strong>Warranty
Programs</strong></a></p> <p>Similar
to rebate programs, some retail businesses offer customers a service
which facilitates product registration for warranty program purposes.
While the standard recommendation with respect to limited retention of
personal information by the retail business applies with equal force as
it does to a company&#39;s handling of rebate information, there is a
particular concern where businesses offer a supplementary or extended
warranty program beyond that provided by the product
manufacturer.</p> <p>For
an additional cost, some retail businesses particularly in the home
electronics sub-sector will offer consumers an opportunity to
supplement a manufacturer&#39;s warranty with a policy that provides
technical support and/or damage protection. For example, Future Shop
offers a &quot;Product Service Plan&quot; on virtually all products sold through
its retail outlets or online store.<a name="_ftnref86" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn86">[86]</a></p> <p>Where
a retail business administers its own extended warranty program,
information regarding coverage is typically connected to the individual
purchasing the product. Future Shop requests the name, address and
telephone number of the individual registering the warranty coverage.
When a customer attends a retail outlet to request warranty service
under the Product Service Plan, the customer is asked either for a
store receipt or for the individual&#39;s phone number to facilitate a
computer search of registered warranty information. Prior to the
implementation of PIPED Act within the provincially-regulated retail
sector on January 1, 2004, Future Shop routinely collected contact
information from customers during every purchase. As part of Future
Shop&#39;s privacy compliance program, customers were thereafter only asked
for personal information when purchasing the Product Service Plan
extended warranty coverage. The information recorded includes the
serial number of the specific product to which the extended warranty
coverage applies.</p> <p>Given the uniqueness of the serial
number,
which prevents individuals from obtaining extended warranty service for
additional products, it is arguably unnecessary to additionally collect
the individual&#39;s personal information to facilitate the computer search
of warranty records. Instead, the company could conduct a search by
serial number of the product submitted for warranty coverage, thus
enabling the consumer to obtain warranty service while retaining
relative anonymity.</p> <p>Interestingly, the Future Shop
privacy
policy makes little mention of its use of personal information in
connection with its warranty program. As part of its privacy statement
in respect of in-store purchases, Future Shop describes the following
policy:</p> <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong>In-Store
Purchases</strong></span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">When
you purchase a Future Shop product or service, you may need to provide
us with contact and payment information (such as credit card
information) so that we can process your request. <u>Examples
where we need contact information include</u> delivery services,
<u>product servicing</u>, in-home installations,
<u>warranty coverage</u>,
and rebate requests. If we collect this information, we will also ask
for your consent to use this information to send you promotional
information on products and services.<a name="_ftnref87" href="index2.php__option=com_content__task=view__id=66__pop=1__page=2__Itemid=80.html#_ftn87">[87]</a> </span></p> <p>In
the privacy statement provided above, Future Shop expressly identifies
warranty coverage as a service mandating an exchange of customers&#39;
personal information. There is no mention of the personal information
being used later to identify and match the product to which the
extended warranty applies. </p> <p>The statement is also
unclear
with respect to why contact information is necessary to provide
warranty coverage. It may be necessary only to inform the individual of
future amendments to the warranty agreement, but the lack of
specificity as to purpose deprives the individual of the benefit of
knowing based on the privacy policy alone whether withholding consent
precludes the purchase of extended warranty coverage. The closing
sentence, which notifies consumers that personal information
necessarily collected for the preceding purposes may later be used with
consent to send promotional information, calls into question the extent
to which the company has actively minimized its information collection
practices.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Privacy statements
appear with increasing regularity on websites of companies in the
retail sector. As with their counterparts in federally regulated
sectors, the privacy statements produced by retail organizations
typically describe privacy practices in general, abstract terms. This
paper addresses some of the privacy issues specifically relevant to the
retail sector as well as provides recommendations for how retail
businesses might expand their privacy statements to reflect
industry-specific privacy concerns. Striking the right balance between
specificity and flexibility may continue to reflect a tension between
openly disclosing a company&#39;s detailed privacy practices and
maintaining the maneuverability provided by non-specific privacy
statements affirming the general principles recognized by the PIPED
Act. If the business community can overcome concerns with respect to
the competitive advantage lost or the liability increased by publishing
detailed privacy manuals, consumers will benefit by having a meaningful
basis on which to assess companies&#39; privacy practices, hold them
accountable for non-compliance, and ultimately guide their purchasing
decisions. Until then, consumers may need to rely on their own
interpretations of PIPED Act and the goodwill of retailers to comply
with the spirit of the legislation and the similarly non-specific
finding reports published by the Privacy Commissioner.</p>
