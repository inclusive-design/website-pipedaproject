				<h1>About the Project</h1>




<p>&#160;The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents
Act (PIPED Act) was enacted to establish rules to govern the legitimate
collection use and disclosure of personal information in a manner that
recognizes the right of individual privacy. </p>


<p>With the application of the PIPED Act to &quot;all commercial activity&quot;
as of January 1st 2004, the
staggered implementation the Act is now complete. Part one of the Act is scheduled
for review in 2006. </p>


<p>The central aim of this project will be to evaluate the implementation of
PIPED Act by reviewing privacy statements posted on the Internet by companies
in the telecommunications, airlines, banking and retail sectors. </p>


<p>Privacy policies provide the consumer with an indication of what he or she
is entitled to expect. This helps to overcome uncertainty in the marketplace
and facilitate a transaction that might not otherwise take place. It has been
noted that consumers are &quot;far less willing to entrust their personal data
to organizations that, at a minimum, don&#39;t have a postedprivacy
statement.&quot; Indeed, the PIPED Act itself is explicitly premised on the
notion that good privacy policies and practices can promote electronic commerce.
</p>


<p>A company&#39;s statement is clearly a communication between the organization
and the consumer as to how personal data will be handled, what is not so clear
is the extent to which privacy policies satisfy the requirement of
&quot;openness&quot; pursuant to PIPED Act </p>


<p>The openness principle states that: </p>


<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">An organization shall make readily available to
individuals specific information about its policies and practices relating to
the management of personal information. </p>


<p>This principle contemplates the consumer being able to ascertain information
about the organization&#39;s business practice with respect to the use collection
and disclosure of personal information without unreasonable effort on the part
of the individual. While this principle is by no means unqualified, it is the
case that an organization&#39;s privacy policy should at a minimum, be in a form
that is intelligible and appropriately conveys both what the consumer is
entitled to expect as well as organization&#39;s statutory obligations. </p>


<p>Organizations make information about their policies and practices available
in a variety of ways. The method chosen depends on the nature of its business
and other considerations. An organization may make brochures in its place of
business, mail information to its customers, provide online access, or
establish a toll-free telephone number. </p>


<p>While these activities can be said to satisfy the requirement of openness in
the PIPED Act concerns remain about the efficacy of these practices in view of
the fact that the majority of unrealized on-line transactions that have
resulted from a lack of openness will go unreported. An informal review of
web-based privacy statements on Canadian private sector sites suggests that
privacy policies are to some extent merely diaphanous expressions of goodwill rather
than a clear articulation of enforceable legal commitments. </p>


<p>This project will compare the approach to communicating privacy policy and
practice by organizations in the airline, telecommunications, banking and
retail sectors. We selected the first three industries because they are
federally regulated and the PIPED Act has applied to them since its entry into
force.</p>

</p>
<p>The Centre for Innovation law and Policy is a not for profit
academic institution located at the University of Toronto Faculty of Law. The
Centre is governed by three bodies: The Executive Committee, the Advisory Board
and the Academic Co-ordinating Committee. The Executive Committee is
responsible for the day-to-day operation of the Centre. These activities are
overseen by the Centre&#39;s Advisory Board. Province wide curricula related to
innovation and the law are guided by the Centre&#39;s Academic Co-ordinating
Committee which includes the Centre&#39;s Executive Director and representatives
from Ontario&#39;s six law schools.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">Working in partnership with the
Centre on this project will be the the Information Policy Research Program
(IPRP) based at the Faculty of Information Studies. Since 1995 IPRP has served
as an organizing umbrella for a series of research projects examining key
public information policy issues, notably access, privacy and governance. These
issues are studied particularly in relation to rapid Canadian developments in
information/communications infrastructure, electronic commerce and the
&#39;knowledge-based economy/society&#39; generally. Three current projects are:
Digital Identity Constructions, Everyday Experiences of Networked Services, and
the Canadian Research Alliance for Community Innovation and Networking, all
funded by the Social Science and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC)<em>. </em>IPRP
also sponsors a variety of events, including the monthly Information Rights
Salon<sup><span style="position: relative; top: -6pt;"> </span></sup>(formerly
the Privacy Lecture Series). Professors </span><span style="color: black;">Andrew Clement</span><span style="color: black;"> and Nadia Caidi, who serve as Research Advisors for this
proposal, are active IPRP researchers.<br />
