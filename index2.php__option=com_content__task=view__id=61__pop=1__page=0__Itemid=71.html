Stephanie Perrin is a well known consultant in privacy and information
policy issues, providing advice to industry and government in the
practical implementation of data protection policies and procedures.
She is an active participant in policy discussions involving civil
liberties, sits on the board of several domestic and international
privacy organizations, and is a Senior Fellow at the Electronic Privacy
Information Centre in Washington. In October 2003 she became the
research coordinator for a four year project on Anonymity, Identity and
Authentication funded by the Social Science and Humanities Research
Council of Canada, an interdisciplinary project led by Dr. Ian Kerr of
the University of Ottawa Common Law faculty.
<br />
<br />
She is the former Chief Privacy Officer of Zero-Knowledge, the first
CPO in Canada, and has been active in a number of CPO associations,
working with those responsible for implementing privacy in their
organizations. As CPO at ZeroKnowledge Systems, Stephanie developed
policy and management systems to implement privacy objectives within
the company, and provided advice and analysis of customer needs and
requirements for Zero-Knowledge products and services. Active in
domestic and international privacy policy and compliance fora,
Stephanie has been involved in privacy issues at the practical, policy
and legislative level for many years.<br />
<br />
Stephanie was instrumental in developing Canada&#39;s privacy and
cryptography policies for over fifteen years. Formerly the Director of
Privacy Policy for Industry Canada&#39;s Electronic Commerce Task Force,
she led the legislative initiative at Industry Canada that resulted in
the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act,
privacy legislation that came into force in 2001 and has set the
standard for private sector compliance. She is the principal author of
a text on the Act, published by Irwin Law.
<br />
<br />
From 1991 until 1999 she represented Industry Canada on the Canadian
Standards Association&#39;s technical committee on privacy, and was a
member of the drafting committee which developed <a href="http://www.csa.ca/standards/privacy/default.asp?load=code" target="_self">CAN/CSA-Q830-96, the Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information</a>.
She was a member of the Ad Hoc Advisory Committee of ISO which examined
the utility of developing a management standard for the protection of
personal information in 1997-98. She represented Canada internationally
at the OECD Security and Privacy Committee for many years and led
Canada&#39;s delegation to the ad hoc working group which developed the
OECD Cryptography Policy Guidelines. In 2001 she was the leader of a
group of experts who prepared a Report on the utility of standards in
implementing the European Directive on data protection.
<br />
<br />
In the early eighties, Stephanie was one of Canada&#39;s first Freedom of
Information and Privacy Officers, and was the first President of the
professional association, the Canadian Access and Privacy Association.
She has received awards for her work in furthering international work
in freedom of information and privacy from the Electronic Frontier
Foundation (Pioneer 2001) and the B.C. Freedom of Information and
Privacy Association (2001).<br />
