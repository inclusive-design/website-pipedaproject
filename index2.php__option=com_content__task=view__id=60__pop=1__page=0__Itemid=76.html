academic centre devoted to the study of innovation law and policy.
Broadly speaking, &quot;innovation law and policy&quot; means the law,
institutions and policies that affect, or are affected by, the
development of technology. Innovation policy considers the wealth
effects and social challenges created by human inventiveness. The
Centre supports teaching, research and policy analysis. Its research
priorities include intellectual property law and economics,
telecommunications policies and regulations, electronic commerce and
the Internet, the social and ethical issues presented by biotechology
and other technologies and the financing and governance of innovative
ventures.<br />
The Centre prepares Ontario&#39;s law graduates to be effective advocates,
advisors and policy-makers within an economy that is driven by
innovation and in a society that is profoundly affected by
technological change. It supports research and policy analysis across
academic disciplines in innovation law and policy which meets the
highest standards of academic excellence.<br />
